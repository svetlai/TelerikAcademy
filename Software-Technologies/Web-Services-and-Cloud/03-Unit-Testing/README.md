## Unit Testing with Web Services
### _Homework_
1. Develop a REST API for a BugLogger app
  * Bugs have status:
      * fixed, assigned, for-testing, pending
  * Bugs have text and logDate
  * Newly added bugs always have status "pending"
  * Bugs can be queried – get all bugs, get bugs after a date, get only pending bugs, etc…
2. Develop a database in MS SQL Server that keeps the data of the bugs
3. Create repositories to work with the bugs database
4. Provide a REST API to work with the bugs
  * Using WebAPI
  * Provide the following actions:
    * Log new bug - `POST …/bugs`
    * Get all bugs - `GET …/bugs`
    * Get bugs after a specific date - `GET …/bugs?date=22-06-2014`
    * Get bugs by status - `GET …/bugs?type=pending`
    * Change bug status - `PUT …/bugs/{id}`
5. Write unit tests to test the BugLogger
  * Use a mocking framework
6. Write integration tests to test the BugLogger
