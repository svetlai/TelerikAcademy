  <definition>
    1. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a 
    format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is defined in the XML 1.0 Specification
    produced by the W3C, and several other related specifications, all free open standards.

  <usage>
    The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability over the Internet. It is a textual data 
    format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on 
    documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures, for example in web services.

  <namespaces>
    3. XML namespaces are used for providing uniquely named elements and attributes in an XML document. An XML instance 
    may contain element or attribute names from more than one XML vocabulary. If each vocabulary is given a namespace, 
    the ambiguity between identically named elements or attributes can be resolved.

    4. In computing, a uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name of a resource. 
    Such identification enables interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World 
    Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. 
    The most common form of URI is the uniform resource locator (URL), frequently referred to informally as a web 
    address. More rarely seen in usage is the uniform resource name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by 
    providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.
