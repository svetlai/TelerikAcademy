# ASP.NET User Controls
1. Create a user control that visualizes a menu of links. The control should have a property to initialize the menu links (a list of items, each containing a title and URL). Use `DataList` and data binding to visualize the menu links. Implement a property to change the font and the font color. Donâ€™t use the `Menu` control!
