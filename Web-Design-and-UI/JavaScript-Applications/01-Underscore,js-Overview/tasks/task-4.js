/* 
Create a function that:
*   **Takes** an array of animals
    *   Each animal has propeties `name`, `species` and `legsCount`
*   **groups** the animals by `species`
    *   the groups are sorted by `species` descending
*   **sorts** them ascending by `legsCount`
*   **prints** them to the console in the format:

```
    ----------- (number of underscores is equal to the length of the GROUP_1_NAME + 1)
    GROUP_1_NAME:
    ----------- (number of underscores is equal to the length of the GROUP_1_NAME + 1)
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the first animal in group 1
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the second animal in group 1
    ----------- (number of underscores is equal to the length of the GROUP_2_NAME + 1)
    GROUP_2_NAME:
    ----------- (number of underscores is equal to the length of the GROUP_2_NAME + 1)
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the first animal in the group 2
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the second animal in the group 2
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the third animal in the group 2
    NAME has LEGS_COUNT legs //for the fourth animal in the group 2
```
